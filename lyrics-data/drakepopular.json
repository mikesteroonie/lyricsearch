I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us",

Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\n[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you?\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give but you cannot take love\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\n[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you?\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give but you cannot take love\n\n[Outro: Baka]\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here eh?\nY'all need to know yourself",

Are you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?\nYou getting money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nUhh, so much for being optimistic\nThey say love is in the air, so I\nHold my breath until my face turn purple\nKeep a few bad bitches in my circle\nMy nuts hang like ain't no curfew\nBitch, if you wave, then I will surf you\nI flew jet, she flew commercial\nBut we still met later that night\nAfter my session, she came over\nI was aggressive and she was sober\nI gave her a pill, she started confessing\nAnd started undressing and ask me to hold her\nAnd so I did, but that was last month\nAnd now she's texting me asking for closure\nDamn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper\nWe eat each other whenever we at the dinner table\nShe say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average\nShit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married\nPromises, I hope I never break 'em\nMet a female dragon, had a fire conversation\nBut, interviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nDo you love this shit? Are you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?\nYou getting money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright, yeah\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nYeah, yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah",

The ride\nWhy won't it stop? The ride\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nYou won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it\nAnd tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished\nAnd steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image\nAnd ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted\nYou need a minute? You got it\nYou know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights\nThe sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life\nApartment 1503: some couches and paintings\nWhen you record with two others that want the same things\nIt start to feel better than home feels\nAnd so you up there every night, you swear you getting close\nThat champagne money was for gas and phone bills\nBut shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most\nYou drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga\nAnd come out every night to let the city see they nigga\nTelling stories that nobody relate to\nAnd even though they hate you\nThey just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga\n\n[Hook: The Weeknd]\nI've been faded too long\nI've been faded too long\nI've been faded too long\nWhy won't it stop? The ride\nWhy won't it stop? The ride\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nI haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long\nI’m driving right up to it now\nMake sure you got your coat on\nThat runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on\nAnd all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs\nFor four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home\nWhat's good at home?\nThe same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known\nMy young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones\nProblem children that all be repping October's Own\nBrand new girl and she still growing\nBrand new titties, stitches still showing\nYeah, and she just praying that it heals good\nI’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good\nI really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret\nThey say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it\nI mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading\nBut I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing\nYoung money maker, season ticket holder\nSeason switching over\nI come through them bitches\nStill scorching as if I didn’t notice\nYou niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda\nI’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas\nThat couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)\nLook at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder\nMy sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it\nMy juniors and senior will only get meaner\nTake care, nigga\n\n[Hook: The Weeknd]\nI've been faded too long\nI've been faded too long\nI've been faded too long\nWhy won't it stop?
