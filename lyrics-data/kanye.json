(Lord)\nMama, you was the life of the party\nI swear you brought life to the party\nWhen you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)\nThat woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)\nVisions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me\nMovin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army\n'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)\nYou want dreams to come true?

(Jesus)\nBut back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)\nYou better have a strategy or you could be a statistic\nLittle boy dies, he's just one of the mystic\nAnd mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)\nAnd she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)\nAnd her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid\nThat's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it\nSixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)\nBut we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)\nBaby shower time, father didn't show up\nNow she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up\nThe water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)\nA year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)\nAnd she's still dependent on her mom\nBig brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun\nHe want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)\nAnd her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)\nIs it real love? Do the scars really heal up?\nFrom all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)\nA week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)\nLeft his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side\nHe seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes\nTo see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)\nEven let him get the last meal\nHe done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)\nHe gotta show him that it's that real\nHe ran up on him with the pipe like, \"****, stand still\" (Jesus)\n\"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry\" (Lord)\n\"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ\"\nHe said, \"Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ\"\nThen big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)\nYou might also like\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nUh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)\nThank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)\nEvery knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)\nTo the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)\nIt's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor\nBack from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)\nI never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)\nBut I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda\nEarthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)\nWhat the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)\nIn Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)\nI shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal\nThe God is interstellar while you fellas remain local\nMy bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)\nAs sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)\nI could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel\nMy sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne\nBut when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)\nI'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)\nMy rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears\nThirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier\nIt's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)\nIt's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nNow we've been through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nHe lives in a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nBeen through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nWhat up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr\nFirst and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office\nYou might not have been the only one that could've did that\nBut you were the one that did do that\nAnd with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight\nYou know, to me, it kinda feels like\nMe, my mother, my brothers, and my kids\nHave all been incarcerated through this journey\nAnd we haven't even been to jail\nWe have been looked at and treated as criminals\nFor being a part of this family\nMy father's truth and the reality that he raised me in\nIs that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)\n'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him\nAnd it is what made the children of today\nAfter twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one\nMy father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world\nAnd will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples\nIf my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction\nInto the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years\nMan, he would be dead to me\nI didn't sign up for that\nI didn't stay on this journey this long for that\nAll my life, man\nI've been waitin' for my father to come home\nThey told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home\nThen they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home\nI went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home\nNow I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated\nHe still not home\nNow even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'\nMatter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren\nAnd they haven't been able to touch they grandfather\nEven though it is not seen that way for some of us\nBut for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community\nWho deserves to breathe free air\nFree my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)64Embed"

The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B.

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?142Embed"
